<h1>The Journey To My Personal Development</h1>
<p> The cosmic difference in all humans is the degree of the attainment of the power of ideas and thought which is consciousness.
    It is because of this opinion that I believe personal development is the ultimate goal to successful living. 
    I am highly convinced that life gives us what we deserve and not what we want. 
    The greaest casualty in life is living beyond the development of our full potential. 
    My personal life been one of great adventure and fun. Its been one of successes and failures and a great deal of it has been personal development
     and the discovery of self, i.e self realisation.
